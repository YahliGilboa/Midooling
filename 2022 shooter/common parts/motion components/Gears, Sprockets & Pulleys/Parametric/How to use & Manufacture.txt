Spur Gear: 
- edit the number of teeth and the module through the part's EQUATIONS.
- in order for the gear to mesh with stock gears from andymark or vex you need to match between the gears' 
DPs (for example 20DP or 32DP)
- there is a conversion chart from DP(Inch) to Module(metric and what is used in the parametric model)

HTD Pulley:
- this is a Parametric Timing Pulley for 5mm HTD belts (the belts we buy from gg yarum)
- edit the amount of teeth through the part's EQUATIONS 
- to add VersaKeys and weight reduction manually unsupress the features containing it

Plate Sprocket:
- edit the amount of teeth through the part's EQUATIONS 
- the sort of chain can be changed from #25 to #35 by changing two 
parameters (In depth explenation on how is in a comment inside the part).


Manufacturing:
Spur Gear - (according to other teams' experience) theses gears should be sent to be laset cut, 
and can be split into thinner plates (in order for the laser to be able to cut) and
than re-stacked to from the full thickness of the gear.

HTD Pulley - done well on our 3D Printer with medium fillings, can also be sent to Stratasys for higher quality 
(but specity it needs to be with high density filling bc they tend to not be too generous with these unless requested).
Pulleys which suffer higher tourqe can also be cun on the CNC 
router (although not yet tested at the time of writing this document).

Plate Sprocket - done well on CNC router. when making this in 2020 we had a rig that held 
the gear above the machine surface in order to 
check if the teeth are well made (by trying the chain on it) during manufacturing. if the chain didnt fit at
first we made the cut again and after a few cuts it was done. also in order for the
#25 chain to fit on it we had to reduce the thicness of the areas where the chain sits 
and we made it on the milling machine with a rig that allowed spinning the sprocket around a central axis 
(this cut was done before cutting the teeth out of the sprocket).
